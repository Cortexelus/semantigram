know let me begin by</text><text start="181.42" dur="3.84">introducing our very distinguished panel
on my far left</text><text start="185.26" dur="4.74">doctor Chris Fox a long-term visitor at
Perimeter Institute who specializes in</text><text start="190" dur="2.68">quantum information and quantum
foundations</text><text start="192.68" dur="4.36">and he&amp;#39;s also an adjunct professor of
physics at the University of New Mexico</text><text start="197.04" dur="3.79">that to him doctor tony like it is a
professor of physics at the University</text><text start="200.83" dur="0.68">of Illinois</text><text start="201.51" dur="5.35">and the 2003 Nobel laureates in Physics
for his work on superfluidity</text><text start="206.86" dur="3.96">he also was a member a predator
Institute Scientific Advisory Committee</text><text start="210.82" dur="4.04">and more recently he was named the mic
an appeal as a release</text><text start="214.86" dur="3.21">distinguished researcher at the
University Waterloo</text><text start="218.07" dur="4.889">on my rights your left doctor said Floyd
a quantum computer engineering professor</text><text start="222.959" dur="3.691">mechanical engineering at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology</text><text start="226.65" dur="4.649">and doctor Leonard Susskind a professor
physics at Stanford University an</text><text start="231.299" dur="1.601">Associate Faculty Member</text><text start="232.9" dur="7">at Perimeter Institute letting you know
this is your panel for this evening</text><text start="245.51" dur="3.9">now if you attended other Perimeter
Institute</text><text start="249.41" dur="3.78">events like this or occasionally listen
to quickly bork&amp;#39;s</text><text start="253.19" dur="3.48">you know something that most people have
figured out</text><text start="256.67" dur="3.58">physicist are not like the rest of us</text><text start="260.25" dur="3.09">I know they look like normal human
beings</text><text start="263.34" dur="3.43">but they don&amp;#39;t see the world the same
way that we do</text><text start="266.77" dur="4.6">take information for example when you&amp;#39;re
I have a question</text><text start="271.37" dur="4.23">what do we do we look at our notebook
you go to the Internet cue</text><text start="275.6" dur="3.91">you asked to leave the information is
just data that out there only have to do</text><text start="279.51" dur="1.08">is find it</text><text start="280.59" dur="4.05">or maybe share it with someone else but
that&amp;#39;s not help businesses view</text><text start="284.64" dur="0.92">information</text><text start="285.56" dur="3.11">they want to know what the information
itself</text><text start="288.67" dur="4.52">is actually mayor so imagine you&amp;#39;re
looking up information on the website</text><text start="293.19" dur="3.57">that you are I we do see the details
that are on the screen</text><text start="296.76" dur="3.6">but suppose you could look inside your
computer with a</text><text start="300.36" dur="4.3">with a really powerful microscope now
you see the actual but simply to</text><text start="304.66" dur="3.76">moving through the wires in the circuit
boards their individual crucial</text><text start="308.42" dur="0.88">information</text><text start="309.3" dur="4.32">these bits are being manipulated and
they&amp;#39;re being transferred here and ears</text><text start="313.62" dur="3.87">tiny little electric charges or you can
look at an Apple</text><text start="317.49" dur="5.679">not the kind to type on but kindly you
want a binder that Apple</text><text start="323.169" dur="3.541">and you&amp;#39;ll see a bite but businesses
she&amp;#39;s</text><text start="326.71" dur="4.59">a bit drama effect I</text><text start="331.3" dur="4">were millionth visitor</text><text start="335.3" dur="3.119">the and those bits to find the Apple its</text><text start="338.419" dur="3.911">it she repeats collards text your its
very existence</text><text start="342.33" dur="3.12">can be defined as pets only information</text><text start="345.45" dur="3.9">so this idea that information physics
are intimately related</text><text start="349.35" dur="3.5">has involved some other worlds greatest
scientist in long-running</text><text start="352.85" dur="3.89">intellectual debates and their ideas
under physicality of information</text><text start="356.74" dur="0.53">provided</text><text start="357.27" dur="4.11">deep dole controversial insights in the
summer the hardest problems in modern</text><text start="361.38" dur="0.88">physics</text><text start="362.26" dur="3.99">including our understanding of the
universe while the smaller problems we</text><text start="366.25" dur="2.37">have black holes</text><text start="368.62" dur="3.36">and paradoxes that you find in quantum
mechanics</text><text start="371.98" dur="4.06">the research is also leading to new
technologies to to calculate the store</text><text start="376.04" dur="1.46">to transmit information</text><text start="377.5" dur="3.24">in cloud computing quantum cryptography</text><text start="380.74" dur="3.9">and quantum teleportation beam me up
Scotty</text><text start="384.64" dur="3.63">so let&amp;#39;s get down to the nitty gritty
and see what</text><text start="388.27" dur="4.4">information how we can glean from our
guest today and I could start with</text><text start="392.67" dur="4.08">doctor said like from MIT mimosa see
information something that you just read</text><text start="396.75" dur="0.63">a review copy</text><text start="397.38" dur="3.22">are you sure somebody else what&amp;#39;s that
got to do with his ex</text><text start="400.6" dur="3.55">well everything certain</text><text start="404.15" dur="4.01">with the one longer into when you&amp;#39;re
going to cook</text><text start="408.16" dur="3.77">this isn&amp;#39;t the news look</text><text start="411.93" dur="4.58">aside for the so so bob actually the</text><text start="416.51" dur="3.18">monitor 150 years ago</text><text start="419.69" dur="3.24">people want sir concerned about
information because they weren&amp;#39;t living</text><text start="422.93" dur="2.33">through an information processing
revolution</text><text start="425.26" dur="3.69">but a hundred and fifty years ago a
bunch of physicists</text><text start="428.95" dur="3.7">on James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge and
Edinburgh</text><text start="432.65" dur="3.48">arm big bossman in Vienna jus I will
gives</text><text start="436.13" dur="4.13">at Yale they actually discovered the
fundamental formula that describes</text><text start="440.26" dur="3.34">information and even describe it</text><text start="443.6" dur="3.21">in terms of bits they discover that for
now because they were looking</text><text start="446.81" dur="4.54">now how Adams move around and they
wanted to quantify this funky stuff</text><text start="451.35" dur="0.68">called</text><text start="452.03" dur="4.32">entropy now entropy was at that time
known as a quantity</text><text start="456.35" dur="4.56">that gums up the works if he&amp;#39;d engines a
steam engine and kept them from doing</text><text start="460.91" dur="4.11">the amount of work you want them to do
but phrase in modern terms what</text><text start="465.02" dur="3.43">Maxwell Boltzmann against discovered was
that entropy is actually</text><text start="468.45" dur="4.05">information its bets so these atoms as
they move around</text><text start="472.5" dur="3.23">they carry bits of information with them
and every time</text><text start="475.73" dur="4.41">two atoms collide those bits flip so in
fact not only</text><text start="480.14" dur="3.03">disinformation have everything to do
with physics but this is actually</text><text start="483.17" dur="1.41">discovered it to begin with</text><text start="484.58" dur="3.04">any can also be what now we have light</text><text start="487.62" dur="3.94">is caring information fiber optics or
could be a quantity of like this were</text><text start="491.56" dur="3.02">yet so if you wanna see what are you
looking at how the information</text><text start="494.58" dur="2.05">processing revolution came about</text><text start="496.63" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s because scientists and engineers
figured all</text><text start="499.78" dur="3.23">everything&amp;#39;s already got this
information associated with it</text><text start="503.01" dur="1.179">lets user</text><text start="504.189" dur="4.72">you know a particle light a photon they
can have a believe information like its</text><text start="508.909" dur="3.781">weekly back and forth like this so by
taking on my Ray Bans I put it like this</text><text start="512.69" dur="3.839">photon we going back and forth like that
in college 0 photon wheeling back and</text><text start="516.529" dur="0.901">forth like this</text><text start="517.43" dur="3.13">for events like that you can call the
one so</text><text start="520.56" dur="4.07">all these you know particles physical
entities have information associated</text><text start="524.63" dur="0.829">with them</text><text start="525.459" dur="3.271">and when we build things like wanna
computers all we&amp;#39;re doing is just taking</text><text start="528.73" dur="0.89">advantage occur</text><text start="529.62" dur="3.62">so does that mean granddad information
is limited by the laws of physics</text><text start="533.24" dur="4.11">darn Tooting where ok</text><text start="537.35" dur="4.01">look good another precise answers sugar
I</text><text start="541.36" dur="3.74">well a good publisher furniture interior</text><text start="545.1" dur="3.919">Chris Polk&amp;#39;s spear from Perimeter
Institute said can you give me an</text><text start="549.019" dur="0.771">example</text><text start="549.79" dur="3.419">on how the laws of physics allows to do
things with information</text><text start="553.209" dur="3.151">no more lately I certainly can but I i
think you know</text><text start="556.36" dur="3.86">actually just to follow up on Sat first
okay I&amp;#39;m going to tell you about the</text><text start="560.22" dur="1.609">first time I saw set Lloyd</text><text start="561.829" dur="4.171">in public he was emphasizing at that
time not that everything can carry</text><text start="566" dur="2.79">information but that everything could be
used to compute</text><text start="568.79" dur="4.77">and Tom to make this dramatic I remember
him pulling off his shoes and putting it</text><text start="573.56" dur="0.469">on the</text><text start="574.029" dur="4.06">on the overhead projector in San you can
even use the source you to compute</text><text start="578.089" dur="4.74">should consider those opinion so when he
says he thinks he&amp;#39;s serious about it</text><text start="582.829" dur="3.38">gonna occur so what was your question</text><text start="586.209" dur="1.591">Russia</text><text start="587.8" dur="3.95">going to say is an example of a little
beyond issue how he could use the laws</text><text start="591.75" dur="0.73">of physics to</text><text start="592.48" dur="3.64">can to million to mention are you do new
things with it</text><text start="596.12" dur="4.05">well you can certainly do new things
when one takes into account quantum</text><text start="600.17" dur="0.73">mechanics</text><text start="600.9" dur="3.88">in in so how shall I say</text><text start="604.78" dur="3.47">here&amp;#39;s a lovely example something called
quantum cryptography</text><text start="608.25" dur="3.57">the task that set before them said</text><text start="611.82" dur="4.38">in printer above to people Allison bob
is that they&amp;#39;d like to share</text><text start="616.2" dur="3.61">a secret net like to communicate to each
other privately</text><text start="619.81" dur="3.35">in the classical world where there was
no connection</text><text start="623.16" dur="3.22">it leaves no knows no seen connection
between</text><text start="626.38" dur="3.62">between physics and information arm</text><text start="630" dur="3.82">when they would send messages back and
forth between each other somebody could</text><text start="633.82" dur="1.17">gather information</text><text start="634.99" dur="3.19">and it has no effect on the on the
carriers have the information</text><text start="638.18" dur="5.52">well in the quantum world there seems to
be a deep connection between</text><text start="643.7" dur="3.05">the property is about things and the
information that one</text><text start="646.75" dur="3.64">can get about them so for instance if
you if you get information about</text><text start="650.39" dur="1.66">something it changes</text><text start="652.05" dur="3.57">changes the system in the process this
leaves a trace</text><text start="655.62" dur="3.69">Alice and Bob can see this trace and
they can learn whether someone is</text><text start="659.31" dur="1.82">listened in on the conversations</text><text start="661.13" dur="3.15">so that&amp;#39;s one exam okay had</text><text start="664.28" dur="3.16">doctors asking how do you how do you
define infringe</text><text start="667.44" dur="3.1">well I think I would call information
everything</text><text start="670.54" dur="3.03">but you need to know about a system to
know</text><text start="673.57" dur="3.43">what happens next so for example</text><text start="677" dur="4.45">arm if you had a bad time for the Pop
Warner backed up from hot water what</text><text start="681.45" dur="1.53">information do you need to know</text><text start="682.98" dur="2.71">in order to know whether to get into
that back to bernard well you need to</text><text start="685.69" dur="2.8">know its temperature in many panels
volume</text><text start="688.49" dur="3.73">democracy warm air and so forth but
that&amp;#39;s a very limited amount of</text><text start="692.22" dur="1.05">information</text><text start="693.27" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s an enormous amount of
information stored in the position</text><text start="697.14" dur="4.18">and porosity every single molecule in
the water if you really wanna know</text><text start="701.32" dur="2.55">exactly what&amp;#39;s going to happen next</text><text start="703.87" dur="3.85">you need to know the position and
velocity every single molecule</text><text start="707.72" dur="0.25">in</text><text start="707.939" dur="4.26">that water so there&amp;#39;s an enormous amount
that hidden information</text><text start="712.199" dur="3.71">hidden information that you don&amp;#39;t really
see when you so when you look at the ER</text><text start="715.909" dur="1.63">the backup for water</text><text start="717.539" dur="3.85">that hidden information the information
that you can see</text><text start="721.389" dur="3.21">is what call entropy and</text><text start="724.599" dur="3.54">arm if you really want to know in detail</text><text start="728.139" dur="4.13">what will happen next from any given
initial starting point</text><text start="732.269" dur="3.89">you need to know all of the information
which means</text><text start="736.159" dur="3.33">everything that can be no I&amp;#39;m all the
numbers</text><text start="739.489" dur="3.3">all the velocities all the positions
which</text><text start="742.789" dur="4.08">are the maximum amount that you can ever
know about that bathtubs with water</text><text start="746.869" dur="3.7">and if you know it you could predict
what will happen next</text><text start="750.569" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s like all information on how close
are we doing little to be like a huge</text><text start="754.709" dur="3.99">amount to confirm it out up a little too
actually knowing that hers in about</text><text start="758.699" dur="0.59">upcoming</text><text start="759.289" dur="3.21">her what we usually when I get into the
bathtub I know the temperature in the</text><text start="762.499" dur="2.331">volume index card</text><text start="764.83" dur="4.18">excellent is it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be
playing a lot his right because it was a</text><text start="769.01" dur="2.05">member of the hidden information</text><text start="771.06" dur="3.95">but you can see and it goes in the
minimum entropy</text><text start="775.01" dur="3.81">but I I&amp;#39;m I wanna a definition hear the
difference between what we think it was</text><text start="778.82" dur="0.68">classic</text><text start="779.5" dur="3.75">physics and quantum yes yes I think</text><text start="783.25" dur="3.21">in principal really is the same thing</text><text start="786.46" dur="3.65">but I&amp;#39;m afraid that to give you the</text><text start="790.11" dur="3.7">sharp distinctions between classical and
um</text><text start="793.81" dur="3.8">quantum I would have to give you a
course in quantum mechanics</text><text start="797.61" dur="3.6">with it so no we don&amp;#39;t have the time
back are</text><text start="801.21" dur="3.34">so I would suggest that you come to my
evening course and</text><text start="804.55" dur="4.84">yeah where it will call quantum
mechanics for old people</text><text start="809.39" dur="5.65">gone about as many people here come once
a week to find out what quantum</text><text start="815.04" dur="0.93">mechanics is</text><text start="815.97" dur="4.33">it&amp;#39;s also on the Internet object but OK
in general terms as I understand it in</text><text start="820.3" dur="2.79">classical music you talking about gross
motions like you</text><text start="823.09" dur="3.67">no it was long as you put something in
action reaction week what I think is</text><text start="826.76" dur="1.02">very small</text><text start="827.78" dur="3.44">what&amp;#39;s going on with Indiana within the
very tiny rural where things don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="831.22" dur="1.23">behave the way they do</text><text start="832.45" dur="3.59">out here you know the character a
quantum information is a little bit</text><text start="836.04" dur="1.41">different than the character</text><text start="837.45" dur="3.17">classical my car information to look or
screen</text><text start="840.62" dur="4.16">in some sense it&amp;#39;s not quite as detailed
the uncertainty principle</text><text start="844.78" dur="4.84">prevents you from morning all the things
that one would think one could know</text><text start="849.62" dur="4.73">classically so you take the pics a

and medium would do well</text><text start="1197.41" dur="4.15">okay am tired a lot to have resembled a
short answer of course is yes</text><text start="1201.56" dur="3.85">mean it was it was established 150 years
ago that</text><text start="1205.41" dur="4.35">everything contains information and that
you know every atom as bits around every</text><text start="1209.76" dur="1.7">chemical I these bits are flipping</text><text start="1211.46" dur="4.57">this table this glass of water been</text><text start="1216.03" dur="5.23">assume yeah i&amp;#39;m having a look there does
pull up information on the processing</text><text start="1221.26" dur="1.9">and i think is a boot SOC</text><text start="1223.16" dur="5.09">I yeah so leave the short answer is yes</text><text start="1228.25" dur="3.76">but then if you actually want to mean
but that something is really not very</text><text start="1232.01" dur="3.54">controversial the time to object to that
was around 1900 and and</text><text start="1235.55" dur="3.92">people fail to do so that&amp;#39;s pretty well
established what he meant by that the</text><text start="1239.47" dur="1.19">universe is a computer</text><text start="1240.66" dur="3.51">yeah so there&amp;#39;s more you can you can say</text><text start="1244.17" dur="4.09">okay its processing information its most
as its most microscopic levels</text><text start="1248.26" dur="2.69">therefore it is a computer that&amp;#39;s good
enough for me</text><text start="1250.95" dur="4.06">but you might also want to know okay the

now we actually know the universe can do</text><text start="1271.46" dur="3.44">stuff like that because my colleagues
and I for going on for no more than 12</text><text start="1274.9" dur="1.34">years have been building</text><text start="1276.24" dur="3.36">quantum computers where we actually
build computers that store</text><text start="1279.6" dur="3.81">that some information on individual
atoms in one out on one bit</text><text start="1283.41" dur="3.38">to paraphrase US Supreme Court that
these for the moment</text><text start="1286.79" dur="3.97">so and yet so we can actually build them
in indeed</text><text start="1290.76" dur="4.15">everything out there that we can did we
look at when we look at a close enough</text><text start="1294.91" dur="5.37">its computed so will give me an example
a universal complication with to</text><text start="1300.28" dur="4.22">a unit we what the university leavers

think if you want it</text><text start="1322.86" dur="3.91">to think that the universe is a computer
and as I say this it&amp;#39;s a scientific fact</text><text start="1326.77" dur="1.67">it&amp;#39;s not really a metaphor</text><text start="1328.44" dur="3.85">and then then the universe&amp;#39;s computing
everything that we see</text><text start="1332.29" dur="3.39">you know the stables been computed by
the microscopic motions</text><text start="1335.68" dur="4.09">these atoms when he&amp;#39;s back but got him
warm and clean for this evening</text><text start="1339.77" dur="5.24">%um people typically picks by it that
was the result of that competition</text><text start="1345.01" dur="3.95">so so everything that we see as a result
of this competition</text><text start="1348.96" dur="3.37">so using just because things are
happening atoms are spinning in</text><text start="1352.33" dur="3.67">molecules or doodling and planets
orbiting stars that</text><text start="1356" dur="3.91">that&amp;#39;s accomplished so flipping
resolutely cannot be described in terms</text><text start="1359.91" dur="1.7">of held its flip</text><text start="1361.61" dur="5.35">what was the reason to think that what
would be an example of a process which</text><text start="1366.96" dur="1.07">is not competition</text><text start="1368.03" dur="2.64">a good question</text><text start="1370.67" dur="3.13">to should a</text><text start="1373.8" dur="4.45">a good make maybe it does let me take it</text><text start="1378.25" dur="5.38">shot at the STU um maybe a hundred and
fifty years ago people might upset the</text><text start="1383.63" dur="1.75">universe is a pluck work mechanism</text><text start="1385.38" dur="5.18">what is the idea that the universe is a

has</text><text start="1394.03" dur="3.64">it has the idea information built into
it I mean of course you know</text><text start="1397.67" dur="4.56">a here you could he&amp;#39;s accused me as I
think you vaguely are</text><text start="1402.23" dur="3.34">up saying how well you know when the

that without saying the word information</text><text start="1445.17" dur="3.19">you could do that dan was information
and</text><text start="1448.36" dur="3.6">also you could also see your computer is

things called quantum states are</text><text start="3161.17" dur="1.1">parameterized by</text><text start="3162.27" dur="3.19">real members so that means it</text><text start="3165.46" dur="4.39">in maybe in weighted set would would

when one performs measurement that he</text><text start="3176.51" dur="2.36">was talking about the reveals no details</text><text start="3178.87" dur="3.78">about the the system that&amp;#39;s been

what is weird is that the information</text><text start="3203.24" dur="1.02">you send</text><text start="3204.26" dur="3.67">from one place to another if you just
look at that information</text><text start="3207.93" dur="3.36">you couldn&amp;#39;t it won&amp;#39;t tell you anything

now part of the discussion</text><text start="4255.43" dur="3.95">we haven&amp;#39;t quite gotten in that

to come out at the existence quantum</text><text start="4263.86" dur="3.879">the World Bank One mechanical rather
than than classical</text><text start="4267.739" dur="4.091">is that we&amp;#39;ve discovered that the

about it one had information about what</text><text start="4280.14" dur="0.78">was actually</text><text start="4280.92" dur="4.62">there in the quantum world it seems that
the information is not about what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4285.54" dur="1.15">actually there</text><text start="4286.69" dur="3.63">but rather what comes about from an
interaction</text><text start="4290.32" dur="3.29">some people talk about these things
called quantum measurements</text><text start="4293.61" dur="2.95">and if one says a quantum state is
information</text><text start="4296.56" dur="3.92">well its information about something and
that something is what will come about</text><text start="4300.48" dur="1.7">from the measurement interaction</text><text start="4302.18" dur="4.37">so I informations always about something

this week this</text><text start="4476.139" dur="4.33">is one of the main questions that people

think that there are on</text><text start="4870.48" dur="3.97">be already in in her ground in black
hole physics ideas and information to</text><text start="4874.45" dur="3.49">prove very powerful and the holographic

universe biting into the competition</text><text start="4881.23" dur="3.14">and the best thing about being about as
competition is actually explain</text><text start="4884.37" dur="1.88">something which is quite mysterious</text><text start="4886.25" dur="3.95">so I&amp;#39;m what something is very mysterious
a reason the physics perspective there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4890.2" dur="3.83">why is there so much meaningful
information in the universe you know why</text><text start="4894.03" dur="3.35">can&amp;#39;t we all just like a bunch of my
grandma launchers mounting around all</text><text start="4897.38" dur="0.88">over the place</text><text start="4898.26" dur="4.729">well can you take something that&amp;#39;s
computing and it gets program at random</text><text start="4902.989" dur="3.901">you can prove mathematically that is
likely to come up with all sorts of</text><text start="4906.89" dur="2.8">strange and complicated and fascinating
patterns</text><text start="4909.69" dur="3.68">weird to be just take the molecules of

learn something about why the universe</text><text start="4918.3" dur="1.89">is complex by thinking how its computer</text><text start="4920.19" dur="3.1">and when it&amp;#39;s done one last question</text><text start="4923.29" dur="3.81">yessir members as they are</text><text start="4927.1" dur="3.74">computer and programs quenchers I&amp;#39;m
gonna</text><text start="4930.84" dur="3.71">question like it the laws of physics a:</text><text start="4934.55" dur="3.52">and the change since the beginning of
time then that would affect is</text><text start="4938.07" dur="4.21">that have any effect on the software and
also the completeness theorems</text><text start="4942.28" dur="3.21">like trying to define up the entire</text><text start="4945.49" dur="3.2">sorta universe you couldn&amp;#39;t do that from
within the</text><text start="4948.69" dur="3.95">like as the computer program ok so that
that&amp;#39;s an excellent question so</text><text start="4952.64" dur="3.69">the laws of physics don&amp;#39;t seem to have
changed very much since the Big Bang</text><text start="4956.33" dur="3.73">Theory might be very different in other
places in this very big universe evolves</text><text start="4960.06" dur="4.02">but other kinds of are scientific law
have changed words the laws of biology</text><text start="4964.08" dur="1.62">are changing all the time</text><text start="4965.7" dur="3.99">because the plaza biology are determined
by the actual physical biological</text><text start="4969.69" dur="1.51">systems that are out there</text><text start="4971.2" dur="4.05">and you wanna about up Goodall&amp;#39;s and
completeness theorem</text><text start="4975.25" dur="3.77">the way that applies to the universe as
a whole at actually going to ride this</text><text start="4979.02" dur="1.82">now by looking at the universe is a
computer</text><text start="4980.84" dur="3.26">10 look fascinating features about

your computer</text><text start="4987.63" dur="3.5">and you said it all computing in some
